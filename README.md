**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**

To interpret the user's needs, it is best to hear the needs directly from the user. In a scrum environment, the product owner is responsible for communicating with the users to determine these needs. The product owner then creates user stories based on this information which are passed down to the development team, allowing the development team to ensure these needs are met. The user stories allow the development team to understand the user's needs without having to communicate directly with the user.

**How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**

When developing programs, it is important to first understand the goals of the program. The program can then be broken down into smaller tasks to be completed. These tasks can be analyzed to determine the scope of each task. The initial goal when developing a program is to get the program to run before you continue to add more features. If the base of the program doesn’t work, then developing further features won’t be useful. 

In my future development work, I hope to incorporate the flexibility of agile. I also hope to incorporate the level of teamwork and communication associated with agile. Overall, I feel that these two features of agile allow for an easier development of projects, and ensure the projects fit the users’ needs.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**

A good team member understands that they are part of a team, and have to collaborate with their other team members. It is important to communicate with your other team members about what you’ve accomplished already and how this affects the project and the other team members. It is also important to communicate any impediments or concerns you have, so that you work alongside other members to resolve those impediments, allowing the project to further along. It is also important to be able to efficiently complete your work so that other team members aren’t receiving an unfair workload.
